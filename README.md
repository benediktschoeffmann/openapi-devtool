Clone the repository.

If you have authorisation problems, you probably don't have ssh setup correctly. Follow guides like this one to setup ssh. [SSH setup guide](https://linuxhint.com/generate-ssh-key-ubuntu/)

Please bear in mind that your ssh key has to be set as an authorization in the repository settings. 

## Installing

Download the latest [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) version - you might consider using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for this.

    npm i -g @lyra-network/openapi-dev-tool @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli
```

Run the generator and npm install script via ```make```:
